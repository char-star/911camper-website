<p>Is there anything better than reading outside? All you couch potatoes, and snugglers, hear me out!</p>

<p>You know, I feel more alive whenever I step outside with a book. The world seems so full of possibilities, and adventures.</p>

<p>There is a reason for that.</p>

<h3 id="let-me-tell-you-when-i-started-reading-outdoors">Let me tell you when I started reading outdoors</h3>

<p>During my childhood, I frequently visited my grandmother’s place at a quaint little village in Telangana. Most of my time there was spent outdoors. From getting up early to play under the bright sun to picnics at nearby farms where we  cooked food outside, each and every day was special.</p>

<p>I remember that one day my grandmother encouraged me  to read outside. She told me, go take advantage of the natural light. At first, I was not very eager to leave the familiarity of reading inside. But, I didn’t want to disobey her. So I stepped out. There was a gentle breeze, the air was scented by frangipani trees, there were constant chirps of birds and  people.  I went and sat down under the shade of a big banyan tree and started reading. I thought that I would leave after some time.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, there was nothing more exhilarating! It was a joy to read while life was happening around.  All my senses were awakened, and I felt more connected to the book, and the world around me. This was a turning point in my reading habit.</p>

<p>Today whenever I step out in Bangalore, I carry a book or two with me. This way I can appreciate the city and the book better!</p>

<h3 id="i-can-tell-you-several-interesting-stories-about-reading-outdoors">I can tell you several interesting stories about reading outdoors</h3>

<p>Each of the places I have visited has come to signify a book memory for me. Like, dozing off at Windmills Craftworks on a hot afternoon while reading Sapiens!</p>

<p>Do you want to know what I liked about reading at Nandi Hills in Bangalore, Hikkaduwa beach in Srilanka, and Enteveedu homestay in Wayanad? You can read it all <a href="/reading-outdoors">here</a></p>

<h3 id="all-that-being-said-i-have-certain-problems-with-reading-outside">All that being said, I have certain problems with reading outside</h3>

<p>Reading makes me really hungry. Everytime I find my reading haven outside, I have to leave not more  than an hour later because of my hunger pangs. Yes, I know. This has happened to most of us.  As I don’t like to eat outside or binge eat snacks, this has really become a nuisance.</p>

<p>Just like any developer, I wanted to immediately tackle the problem. I listed out ways to solve it. Should I pack food? But, how much food? And, what if I want to sleep in between, and then get back to reading at the same place? I should tell you why I am mentioning this. You see,  I have, at multiple times, dozed off at cafes while reading, and more than once been startled awake by awkward coughs and strained ‘sir, please wake up’. So, the issue of sleeping arrangement was also something that I needed to address.</p>

<p>So, I began reading on the internet, talking to people, and picking their brains on how to take the convenience of home to whichever place I want to read or camp.</p>

<p>And that eventually, my friend, led to the building of 911camper!</p>

<p>This camper is going to feed my vagabond reading habits, and also give me the option of extending my stay wherever I want to.</p>
